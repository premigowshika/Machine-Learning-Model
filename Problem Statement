When an employee quits the organization, they take way experience, skill, knowledge acquired over a period of time within the organization. This affects the organization and the impact is not only restricted to that but also brings the task of finding a suitable replacement. Mostly the suitable replacement is hired from external and it again adds time and cost to the organization.

Explore the dataset and check if the data can be used as-is.
Determine the relationship between satisfaction level and working hours of employees who have left the organization.
Understand the effect of satisfaction level, department, promotion in last 5 years and salary level of employees who have left the organization.
Build  a machine learning model to predict  the exit of employees.
